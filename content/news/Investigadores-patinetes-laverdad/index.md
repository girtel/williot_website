draft: false
abstract: "Researchers from the Technical School of Telecommunications Engineering of the Polytechnic University of Cartagena (UPCT) have installed a parking and charging station for scooters on the Muralla del Mar campus. The researchers propose to use these personal mobility vehicles to collect data on pollution and process them with artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to predict situations of high pollution, and make decisions such as road traffic management or the recommendation of healthy pedestrian routes.
The work is part of the developments carried out in different research projects on connected urban mobility, in the research group GIRTEL, in which Professor José Santa Lozano is a researcher."
