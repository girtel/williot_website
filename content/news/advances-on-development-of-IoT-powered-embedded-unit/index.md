title: Advances on development of IoT-powered embedded unit
date: 2024-05-13
draft: false
abstract: "The design of a new IoT embedded unit of low cost and low-cost development has reached a new stage. The next prototype is on the way and this piece of news reports the main advances to the general public. The solution will be provided with LoRaWAN connectivity, GPS and particle+clime sensors to report pollution data. The validation will be carried out in a fleet of e-scooters hosted by the GIRTEL group."
