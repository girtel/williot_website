The WILLIOT project proposes a simulation framework using ray-tracing for LPWAN, 5G and beyond 5G (B5G) networks if the field of mobile IoT, which will provide accurate performance indicators under different network configuration parameters and variable reference scenarios. Simulation results will be extracted from modelled scenarios and compared with real measurements taken for a real LoRaWAN/5G deployment based on connected personal mobility vehicles. This will involve a mobile IoT scenario covering a broad area with diverse connectivity locations.
