    abstract = "The adoption of Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LP-WAN) for interconnecting remote wireless sensors has become a reality in smart scenarios, covering communications needs of large Internet of Things (IoT) deployments. The correct operation and expected performance of such network scenarios, which can range hundreds or thousands of nodes and tens of squared kilometres, should be assessed before carrying out the deployment to save installation and maintenance costs. Common network planning tools can help to roughly study potential coverage, but network simulation offers fine-grained information about network performance. Nevertheless, current simulation frameworks include limited propagation models based on statistical and empirical measurements that do not consider scenario particularities, such as terrain elevation, buildings or vegetation. This is critical in urban settings. In this line, this paper presents a simulation framework including a network simulator, a 3D engine and a ray-tracing tool, which models realistically the performance of Long-Range Wide-Area Network (LoRaWAN) communication technology. We have evaluated the performance of the solution taking as reference experimental campaigns in the city of Cartagena (Spain), comparing data obtained when simulating with the commonly employed propagation models such as Okumura–Hata or path loss. Results indicate that our framework, set-up with data from open geographical information systems, accurately fits experimental values, reporting improvements between 10\% and 50\% in the error committed when estimating signal strength in challenging urban streets with signal obstruction, as compared with the better performing classical model, Okumura–Hata."

abstract = {Accurate environmental monitoring is becoming the basis for assuring sustainable development in administrations at different levels, including cities and industry as key actors. However, current techniques rely on static stations that may not be representative of larger areas, for the case of outdoor scenarios, or even not considering indoor spaces where people can remain for long periods. This is the case of vehicles. The COVID-19 pandemic has remarked the importance of measuring air quality indoors, for instance. With the aim of solving this two-fold issue, this work proposes an in-cabin and outdoor air pollution monitoring system to assure healthy conditions when travelling, driving and operating vehicles, and to analyse the evolution of environmental parameters in cities. This effort is carried out exploiting distributed computing with micro-services, betting for an on-board hardware solution provided with sensors for measuring particulate matter, CO, CO2, NO2, O3, temperature and humidity. While basic data pre-processing is carried out in this acquisition unit, edge processing is performed on a single board computer aboard and intermediary communication nodes in the network path from the vehicle to the cloud. Vehicle connectivity is provided by 4G cellular and Low-Power Wide-Area (LPWAN) networks. Global environmental perception is acquired by cloud-based software powered by machine learning and time series analysis. The whole solution has been validated and tested in the city of Cartagena (Spain), with good performance in terms of data collection, communication links and service offered.}

ABSTRACT = {People with type 1 diabetes (T1D) need to monitor their blood glucose level frequently and use insulin to regulate it. T1D typically develops in young individuals and requires lifelong insulin injections for glycemic control. High or low blood glucose levels can lead to serious health issues. To address the challenges posed by regular monitoring and manual insulin injections, automated glucose control methods have been developed. Various insulin regimes are used to manage blood sugar levels, such as traditional regimes that involve one or two injections per day or multiple daily injection therapy, which offers more flexibility in the diet and dosage but still requires patients to monitor their carbohydrate intake and insulin injections. A proportional integral derivative (PID) controller is an automated glucose control method that is commonly used in commercial and research settings due to its simplicity and robustness. However, despite its effectiveness, this method can be affected by external factors like food, exercise, and illness. This study proposes to set an individualized observation frequency (OF) per user for the PID controller for blood glucose control in T1D. Optimizing the OF improves the PID controller’s performance, maintaining or elevating median glucose levels. Tuning the OF offers a simple and effective enhancement for the widely used PID controller.},

abstract = {Pollution in urban areas is turning into a primary focus for local governments in developed nations around the globe. Lots of data are currently collected for this from smart developments provided with atmospheric and climatic sensors. A hot research line is now exploiting such data to extract patterns and predict pollution levels in such a way that countermeasures can be taken beforehand and exposure to harmful concentrations is avoided. However, a key issue is the lack of significant data, due to incomplete smart infrastructures or calibration problems in sensors. Dealing with this, in this paper we propose the exploitation of synthetic data generation to enhance pollution prediction based on limited data sources, concretely extending real measurements of two weeks to up to ten extra years. We present a data generation approach based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), with a particular model focused on generating artificial pollution data, which is later exploited using different Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. Results indicate that the usage of synthetic data further improves prediction when used as the basis dataset to be later finetuned using real records. For 62% of pollutants this way to proceed in data mixing (among five different approaches) provides the best results in evaluations. Such effect is due to extra model robustness due to data regularization, and better generalization capabilities by avoiding sensor limitations in real deployments.}
