    abstract = "The adoption of Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LP-WAN) for interconnecting remote wireless sensors has become a reality in smart scenarios, covering communications needs of large Internet of Things (IoT) deployments. The correct operation and expected performance of such network scenarios, which can range hundreds or thousands of nodes and tens of squared kilometres, should be assessed before carrying out the deployment to save installation and maintenance costs. Common network planning tools can help to roughly study potential coverage, but network simulation offers fine-grained information about network performance. Nevertheless, current simulation frameworks include limited propagation models based on statistical and empirical measurements that do not consider scenario particularities, such as terrain elevation, buildings or vegetation. This is critical in urban settings. In this line, this paper presents a simulation framework including a network simulator, a 3D engine and a ray-tracing tool, which models realistically the performance of Long-Range Wide-Area Network (LoRaWAN) communication technology. We have evaluated the performance of the solution taking as reference experimental campaigns in the city of Cartagena (Spain), comparing data obtained when simulating with the commonly employed propagation models such as Okumura–Hata or path loss. Results indicate that our framework, set-up with data from open geographical information systems, accurately fits experimental values, reporting improvements between 10\% and 50\% in the error committed when estimating signal strength in challenging urban streets with signal obstruction, as compared with the better performing classical model, Okumura–Hata."

abstract = {Accurate environmental monitoring is becoming the basis for assuring sustainable development in administrations at different levels, including cities and industry as key actors. However, current techniques rely on static stations that may not be representative of larger areas, for the case of outdoor scenarios, or even not considering indoor spaces where people can remain for long periods. This is the case of vehicles. The COVID-19 pandemic has remarked the importance of measuring air quality indoors, for instance. With the aim of solving this two-fold issue, this work proposes an in-cabin and outdoor air pollution monitoring system to assure healthy conditions when travelling, driving and operating vehicles, and to analyse the evolution of environmental parameters in cities. This effort is carried out exploiting distributed computing with micro-services, betting for an on-board hardware solution provided with sensors for measuring particulate matter, CO, CO2, NO2, O3, temperature and humidity. While basic data pre-processing is carried out in this acquisition unit, edge processing is performed on a single board computer aboard and intermediary communication nodes in the network path from the vehicle to the cloud. Vehicle connectivity is provided by 4G cellular and Low-Power Wide-Area (LPWAN) networks. Global environmental perception is acquired by cloud-based software powered by machine learning and time series analysis. The whole solution has been validated and tested in the city of Cartagena (Spain), with good performance in terms of data collection, communication links and service offered.}
